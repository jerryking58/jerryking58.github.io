Hi, I'm *Jerry*. I am a graduate student from Peking University, who is trying hard
to be an excellent programmer.

My recent work is on **code search**, which helps programmers find good code snippets
to implement a speicfic feature based on a large-scale code base with the help of
**NLP** and **machine learning**.
