My personal website where I talk about my study and work.

## How it works.
I use jekyll, a tool to generate static websites from text files
written in some markup languages such as html, markdown and textfile.
The template is a fork from [Zeno Rocha's personal website](http://zenorocha.com/).
The content is all written by me.
